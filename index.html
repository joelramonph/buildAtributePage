      <h4>Here's a time line of Dr. Borlaug's life:</h4>
      <section id="tribute-info">

        <ul>
          <li><strong>1914 </strong> - Born in Cresco, Iowa</li><br>
          <li> <strong>1933</strong> - Leaves his family's farm to attend the University of Minnesota, thanks <br>
            to a Depression era program known as the "National Youth Administration"</li><br>
          <li> <strong>1935</strong> - Has to stop school and save up more money. Works in the Civilian<br>
            Conservation Corps, helping starving Americans. "I saw how food changed <br>
             them", he said. "All of this left scars on me."</li><br>
          <li> <strong>1937</strong> - Finishes university and takes a job in the US Forestry Service</li><br>

          <li> <strong>1938</strong>  - Marries wife of 69 years Margret Gibson. Gets laid off due to budget <br>
             cuts. Inspired by Elvin Charles Stakman, he returns to school study under <br>
              Stakman, who teaches him about breeding pest-resistent plants.</li><br>
          <li> <strong>1941</strong> - Tries to enroll in the military after the Pearl Harbor attack, but is <br>
             rejected. Instead, the military asked his lab to work on waterproof glue, DDT <br>
              to control malaria, disinfectants, and other applied science.</li> <br>
          <li> <strong>1942</strong> - Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant Pathology</li> <br>
          <li><strong>1944</strong> - Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont, leaves behind his <br> pregnant wife, and flies to Mexico to head a new plant pathology program.<br>
             Over the next 16 years, his team breeds 6,000 different strains of disease <br>
              resistent wheat - including different varieties for each major climate on Earth.
          </li><br>
          <li><strong>1945</strong> - Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each season, doubling wheat <br>
             yields</li> <br>
          <li><strong>1953</strong> - crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with a high-yeidling <br>
            American breed, creating a strain that responds well to fertilizer. It goes on to <br>
             provide 95% of Mexico's wheat.</li> <br>

          <li><strong>1962</strong> - Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding strains of wheat to the Indian  <br>
            subcontinent in time to help mitigate mass starvation due to a rapidly  <br>
            expanding population</li> <br>
            <li><strong>1970</strong> - receives the Nobel Peace Prize</li> <br>

            <li><strong>1983</strong>helps seven African countries dramatically increase their maize and <br>
               sorghum yields</li><br>
            <li><strong>1984</strong> - becomes a distinguished professor at Texas A&M University</li> <br>
            <li><strong>2005</strong> - states "we will have to double the world food supply by 2050." Argues <br>
               that genetically modified crops are the only way we can meet the demand, <br> as we run out of arable land. Says that GM crops are not inherently dangerous <br>
                because "we've been genetically modifying plants and animals for a long <br>
                 time. Long before we called it science, people were selecting the best <br>
                  breeds."</li> <br>
            <li><strong>2009</strong> - dies at the age of 95.</li><br>
